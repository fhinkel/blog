# Public speaking
### [November 2018: JSConf Columbia](https://jsconf.co/)

### [October 2018: NodeConf Argentina](https://2018.nodeconf.com.ar/)

### [October 2018: JS Interactive](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/js-interactive-2018/)

#### What's New in Node.js Core?

> Node.js 10 just entered Long Term Support (LTS). Let’s look at some exciting new features and what the future holds for Node.js Core.

### [August 2018: Cloud Next Extended 2018 @GDGNYC](https://www.meetup.com/gdgnyc/events/244123962/)

### [May 2018: RevolutionConf](https://revolutionconf.com/)

#### Speed, Speed, Speed: JavaScript vs C++ vs WebAssembly

> In Node.js, we can use WebAssembly modules and native C++ addons. If your app has performance critical parts, should you stay in JavaScript? Or write a native C++ addon? Or use WebAssembly? We’ll look at how these options compare performance wise and which one is best for different workloads. So the next time you need to optimize for speed, you know your options.

### [November 2017: NodeFest](http://nodefest.jp/2017/)

### [October 2017: Node Interactive](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive)

> Franziska will discuss her perspective on Chrome V8 in Node.js, and what the Chrome V8 team is doing to continue to support Node.js. Want to know what the future of browser development looks like? This is a must-attend keynote.  ([Featured Speakers](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive/program/featured-speakers#franzi-hinkelmann))

### [July 2017: JSChannel](http://2017.jschannel.com/)

[Julian Sara Joseph](https://medium.com/@jsj14) summarized my talk [in this post](https://medium.com/@jsj14/js-channel-2017-b9e517e27a92).

### [June 2017: Dinosaur JS](https://confreaks.tv/videos/dinosaurjs2017-javascript-engines-how-do-they-even)

### [June 2017: Web Rebels](https://youtu.be/dG6FWBs0JYM)

### [May 2017: JSConfEU](https://2017.jsconf.eu/)
> Want to know how JavaScript engines work? Why is JavaScript so fast? What is just-in-time compilation? We’ll look at basic concepts of compilers, challenges posed by modern JavaScript, and how to write compiler-friendly JavaScript.  ([Slides](https://fhinkel.github.io/JSEngines-HowDoTheyEven/JSConfEU/))

### [January 2017: Script 17](https://youtu.be/j6LfSlg8Fig)

> Do you care about performance? Memory leaks, megamorphic cache misses, and deoptimizations can slow your app down. We’ll dive deep into the inner workings of V8, Chrome’s JavaScript engine, to better understand what these terms mean.  V8 ships with its own profiling tools that can identify such problems. You’ll learn to identify and fix low-level JavaScript performance issues using several V8 developer tools. ([Slides](https://fhinkel.github.io/PerformanceProfiling))
