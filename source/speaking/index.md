### [September 2018: NYC Nodejs](https://www.meetup.com/nodejs/events/254616023/)

### [May 2018: RevolutionConf](https://revolutionconf.com/)

#### Speed, Speed, Speed: JavaScript vs C++ vs WebAssembly

> In Node.js, we can use WebAssembly modules and native C++ addons. If your app has performance critical parts, should you stay in JavaScript? Or write a native C++ addon? Or use WebAssembly? We’ll look at how these options compare performance wise and which one is best for different workloads. So the next time you need to optimize for speed, you know your options.

([Slides](https://fhinkel.github.io/JSEngines-HowDoTheyEven/JSConfEU/))

### [January 2017: Script 17](https://youtu.be/j6LfSlg8Fig)

> Do you care about performance? Memory leaks, megamorphic cache misses, and deoptimizations can slow your app down. We’ll dive deep into the inner workings of V8, Chrome’s JavaScript engine, to better understand what these terms mean.  V8 ships with its own profiling tools that can identify such problems. You’ll learn to identify and fix low-level JavaScript performance issues using several V8 developer tools. ([Slides](https://fhinkel.github.io/PerformanceProfiling))
