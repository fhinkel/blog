# Free Coaching Sessions for Women in Tech

I provide one-on-one coaching to individuals looking for support, at any stage. My expertise is in backend software engineering, career development, FAANG interviews, developer relations, Cloud, and people management. 

We’ll meet whenever you need an outside perspective from an experienced engineering leader via video chat. I’m also happy to help you brainstorm and edit your resume and job applications.

Meeting with me is like having a one-on-one with a manager who cares deeply about, and is invested in, you and your own growth. I'm there to give you feedback, advice, and most importantly, to help you to introspect and find the answers that already live inside of you.
