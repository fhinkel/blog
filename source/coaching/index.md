description: Free career coaching for software engineers
---
**I'm offering free coaching sessions for women in tech.**

We’ll meet whenever you need a gut check, advice, or an outside perspective from an experienced engineering leader in 45-minute video calls. I’m also happy to help you brainstorm and edit documentation, comms plans, career ladders, and more.

I provide one-on-one coaching to individuals looking for support, at any stage. I’m eager to help you grow into your own leadership style, and make management work for, and not against, you.

Meeting with me is like having a one-on-one with a manager who cares deeply about, and is invested in, you and your own growth. I'm there to give you feedback, advice, and most importantly, to help you to deeply introspect and find the answers that already live inside of you.
