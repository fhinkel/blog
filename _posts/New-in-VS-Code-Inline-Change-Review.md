## Expandable Git annotations in the gutter like in WebStorm ðŸŽ‰

Since VS Code [1.18](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_18), you can expand the little Git [annotations in the gutter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_gutter-indicators) like in WebStorm. They show the diff inline in the editor and make individual reverts easy.

The Git annotations in the gutter are subtle yet helpful. **They instantly draw my eyes to the lines that I changed.** Together with the inline view of the diff and the revert button, they are invaluable to me.

I need the inline change review when I delete too many lines or type in the wrong window. I need it when I make multiple changes and realize one of them doesnâ€™t work. I need it when I refactor and want to compare to the previous version. Iâ€™m so happy this feature is in [VS Code now](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_18#_inline-change-review) ðŸ’š. I could do all of this on the command line, but inline is clearer because I donâ€™t have to adjust to a different view or sort through all the other changes.

A blue bar in the gutter indicates that the line was changed. For new lines, the bar is green. A little red triangle symbolizes deleted lines.

Click on a gutter annotation to see the changes. I often find this more convenient than looking at the diff in other views. There is a revert button next to every change. In many cases, clicking the button is much quicker than using `git checkout --patch` (tough `git commit -p` is one of my favorite tools).
